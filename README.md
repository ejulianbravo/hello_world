# hello_world
My first repository.
This is my first attempt to learn applied Data Science and how to use this platform.
I'll try to take a course on Coursera of Data Science and continue learning Python in Udacity.
Next time I'll edit this readme I'll write about the process.
I hope this project is succesful.
